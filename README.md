# LixVPN
LixVPN â€“ Experimental but modern-looking VPN client frontend. Basically a OpenVPN frontend if you will. GUI is client-side (not web).

## First-time installation
Before connecting to a VPN server, you will need to add one first. This can be done by 

## Run (Linux)
> *Run it in this directory!*

With graphical **user interface** (recommended): 
- `sh cli.sh`

Just in your **terminal** (advanced):
- `sh gui.sh`

## Supported Systems
- Linux (recommended: Debian/Ubuntu-based distros such as *Pop_OS!* or *Linux Mint*)
    - At the moment, only such systems are supported. This might change in the future if I finally set up a Windows VM.

## CLI Args
- `--no-sudo`/`--ns`
    - Removes the sudo prompt.
