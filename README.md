### Supported Systems
- Linux (recommended: Debian/Ubuntu-based distros such as *Pop_OS!* or *Linux Mint*)
    - At the moment, only such systems are supported. This might change in the future if I finally set up a Windows VM.

### Warning
You should to use `sudo` to use the program! Otherwise, the program will ask you at startup.
- `sudo python3 src/gui.py`
